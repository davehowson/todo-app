# TO DO APP

This is a web based application that helps users manage their daily activities by storing reminders.
This was developed as an attempt to learn Spring Framework and ReactJS and its core is based on [this](https://www.callicoder.com/spring-boot-spring-security-jwt-mysql-react-app-part-1/) tutorial.
The TO DO APP was created based on a personal need to have a multiplatform task management service. This project is still at its initial stage and I hope to add more functionality in the future.
Currently, this application provides users with the ability to authenticate using token based authentication, create tasks and mark them as complete or incomplete. 
Future developments include UI improvements, additional task related and user management functionality and applications for multiple platforms.
